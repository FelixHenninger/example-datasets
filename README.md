# example-datasets

This repository is the home for a series of datasets that our intrepid guinea pig researchers will attempt to adapt to the Psych-DS specification. These datasets will (initially) help us discover practical challenges and remaining ambiguities in the specification and (later) provide a series of examples that can be used by researchers looking for examples & templates, and for developers looking to test code (e.g. the validator!) over real data.

Contributing to this project (by adding a dataset of your own or helping with someone else's) can be done in two ways:

(1) By [forking this repository and then submitting a pull request](LINK) OR by emailing Melissa Kline (mekline@mit.edu) if you want to contribute or modify a dataset and aren't familiar with GithHub.

(2) By modifying the 'how to' document: It currently contains a skeleton of how to create spec-compliant datasets, and we'll iterate on it so it actually provides *helpful* help for someone using the specification for the first time. 

*Anyone* can contribute to this project! Please have a look at the [Psych-DS code of conduct](LINK) for our community guidelines, and feel free to email Melissa Kline (mekline@mit.edu) with any questions about the guinea pig datasets or Psych-DS more generally.  

## Status

Here we go! Volunteers will be uploading their source_data/ files over the next few weeks, and then modifying them to meet the specification. 

The google doc How-To document is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k3ZzAF8vrJeIcMN3q5g_l7WJtoybokvq5ueYVH0dcC8/edit?usp=sharing); please modify it freely.
