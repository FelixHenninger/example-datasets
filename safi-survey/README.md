# SAFI Survey example dataset for Psych-DS specification

It serves as an example for how a Psych-DS dataset could look like. Dataset used in this example is the SAFI (Studying African Farmer-Led Irrigation) Survey, part of a project about farming and irrigation methods. This is survey data relating to households and agriculture in Tanzania and Mozambique. The survey data was collected through interviews conducted between November 2016 and June 2017. The survey covered such things as; household features (e.g. construction materials used, number of household members), agricultural practices (e.g. water usage), assets (e.g. number and types of livestock) and details about the household members. Original data source:

This dataset is also used in the [R for Social Scientists](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/) lesson from [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/). The `SAFI_clean.csv` file was used to create a simple example dataset for Psych-DS.
