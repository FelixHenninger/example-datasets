# NIH reviews

The nih-reviews project contains data taken from [Forscher, Cox, Brauer, and Devine (2019)](https://psyarxiv.com/r2xvb), in which 446 scientists each reviewed 3 of 48 NIH R01 grant proposals.  412 of these scientists were used for the primary analysis in the manuscript.  The nih-reviews folder contains:

* *dataset_description.json*. This is a json file containing machine-readable meta-data for this project
* *codebook.xlsx*.  This is a codebook containing descriptions of each variable in nih_data.tsv
* *raw_data*.  This contains the raw and source datafiles from this project
